# Valentines Project

Welcome to the Valentines Project! This is a fun and interactive project for Valentine's Day.

## How It Works

When you open the project, you'll see a cute Valentine's Day GIF. Below the GIF, there are two buttons: "Yes" and "No".

- If you click "Yes", you'll be taken to a thanking page.
- If you click "No", the "No" button will get smaller, and the "Yes" button will get bigger, making "Yes" the only option!
